**We have just launched a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! ðŸŽ‰

On the 0.8.3 [release](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.8.3), we made a lot of improvements and bug fixes. This post will give a quick overview of this release and add some highlights of our [0.8.2](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.8.2) and [0.8.1](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.8.3) releases. I hope you enjoy it!**

Cool, right? On some days, I will post here the link of the PR, showing my strategy to implement this :-)

If youâ€™re a DMN editor user, stay tuned! This enhancement is just one of many others the team is bringing to the editor.
