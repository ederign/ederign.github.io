We have just launched a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! ðŸŽ‰

On the 0.8.3 [release](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.8.3), we made a lot of improvements and bug fixes. This post will give a quick overview of this release and add some highlights of our [0.8.2](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.8.2) and [0.8.1](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.8.3) releases. I hope you enjoy it!

## BPMN and DMN Standalone Editors

Since 0.7.2.alpha3 we started [shipping](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kogito-tooling/kie-editors-standalone) a new component of the KIE tooling, our standalone BPMN and DMN Editors. On the 0.8.1 release, we delivered the first official version of this cool library.  ðŸŽ‰

These Standalone Editors provide a straightforward way to use our tried-and-true DMN and BPMN Editors embedded in your web applications.

The editors are now distributed in a self-contained library that provides an all-in-one JavaScript file for each of them that can be interacted with using a comprehensive API for setup and control it.

Now it's super easy to embed our editors in your applications:

Cool, right? On some days, I will post here the link of the PR, showing my strategy to implement this :-)

If youâ€™re a DMN editor user, stay tuned! This enhancement is just one of many others the team is bringing to the editor.
