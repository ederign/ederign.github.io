            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, our team released a new import piece of our tool belt, the Business Modeler Desktop. This modeler is a multi-platform standalone application that enables you to quickly create and edit DMN and BPMN assets on your Desktop.</p><p>This post will do a quick overview of this cool new tool. I hope you guys enjoy it!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tSAeHRpxOrY4iJVMKXAawg.png" /></figure><h3>DMN and BPMN Modeler</h3><p>From the initial screen, you will be able to create new BPMN workflows and DMN Decision Models or use our samples as a starting point to your models!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/801/1*iWoNThc8HPmlNTCp5s7orQ.gif" /></figure><p>We also provide a quick way to filter your recent files and see previews of your diagrams.</p><h3>Importing code to Business Modeler</h3><p>Another cool feature of Business Modeler is the ability to import BPMN or DMN models via URL. For instance, you can import this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/stable/dmn-quarkus-example/src/main/resources/Traffic%20Violation.dmn">model</a> from our examples:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jxQdAbOjhOmNUC2SX6CC1w.gif" /></figure><p>Remember to make sure that your models on the URL are text content. If you are using Github, you need to provide the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/stable/dmn-quarkus-example/src/main/resources/Traffic%20Violation.dmn">raw</a> link of the desired model. The same applies to Dropbox Links (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/s4j1qfsip8sj98k/sample.dmn?dl=0">example</a>).</p><h3>Learn More</h3><p>If you are new to BPMN or DMN or maybe want to become an expert, you can go to our ‘Learn More’ section and check useful links for our tutorials, highlighting our “<a href="http://learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com/">Learn DMN in 15 minutes</a>” web site.</p><h3>Thank you to everyone involved!</h3><p>I want to thank everyone involved with this release from the awesome KIE Tooling Team Engineers to the lifesavers QEs and the UX people that help us look awesome!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e911e78f9e11" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/business-modeler-desktop-preview-released-e911e78f9e11">Business Modeler Desktop Preview Released</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation">kie-tooling</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I hope you guys enjoy it!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*jJq01KE93oL7wPSR" /></figure><h3>Kogito Tooling</h3><p>Kogito, the newest project from the KIE group, is cloud-native business automation for building intelligent applications, backed by battle-tested capabilities.</p><p>Kogito is designed from the ground up to run at scale on the cloud. By taking advantage of the latest technologies (Quarkus, Knative, etc.), you get amazingly fast boot times and instant scaling on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.</p><p>The project also goes beyond technology, and it also provides a focus on the domain. It replaces traditional generic API by a domain-based API, avoiding unnecessary abstraction leaks of the underline tools used.</p><p>Kogito focuses on developers, and this is where the BPMN Extension for VSCode plays an important role. Additional to the extension, Kogito also provides:</p><p>Tooling embeddable wherever you need it</p><ul><li>Code generation taking care of 80% of the work;</li><li>Flexibility to customize, only use what you need;</li><li>Simplified local development with live reload.</li></ul><p>To learn more about Kogito, please visit the <a href="http://kogito.kie.org/">kogito.kie.org</a> website.</p><p>In the second semester of 2019, our team was responsible for building the infrastructure of the kogito tooling.</p><p>We had a remarkable year for the kogito tooling! I’m proud of the excellent work and innovation that we were able to accomplish on this initiative. Let’s take a look:</p><h4>BPMN/DMN VSCode Extension</h4><p>This release in September marked the first piece of the new tooling infrastructure for the Kie Group Team. With VSCode support, our goal was to streamline the dev workflow of our platform, making it easy for developers to create BPMN diagrams and push them straight to kogito runtimes.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4RkMgQiLy4zHDwtTdX1NQw.gif" /></figure><p>Take a look at the full <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/bpmn-vscode-extension-released-alpha-1782ddaa2a4e">blog post</a>.</p><h4>Github Chrome Extension</h4><p>In October, we released our GitHub Chrome Extension. With this new tool, users are able not just to edit but also visualize DMN/BPMN diagrams — which is especially cool on Pull Request reviews.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjzlhOWBPSc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjzlhOWBPSc</a></p><p>See the original blog <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/building-your-own-custom-editors-with-kogito-tooling-npm-packages-c33caed6c668">post</a>, and the posts describing the cool improvements [<a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/kogito-tooling-chrome-extension-improvements-ff42777cae19">1</a>] [<a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/kogito-online-dmn-bpmn-editor-and-chrome-extension-improvements-fe09353affc7">2</a>] that we launched in December:</p><h4>Online Editor</h4><p>In December, we launched the first alpha release of our brand new Kogito Online Editor. It can be accessed here: <a href="http://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online">http://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*SK5gNffvOe7bKdZzlvtIog.gif" /></figure><p>The Kogito Online Editor provides a simple way to edit DMN and BPMN files directly on your browser. You can create a file from scratch or upload an existing one from your device.</p><h4>Kogito Tooling Resource Content API</h4><p>In December, we also launched Resource Content API, a common API able to fetch content across different Channels(VSCode/Chrome/Online), an example of this need is the DMN Editor that imports another DMN model. Another example is a Runtime Process Admin UI that needs access to the Process Definition (the content of a BPMN file). See the full <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/reading-resources-with-the-new-resource-content-api-cd64df915fcd">blog</a> post for details.</p><p>That is it for the Kogito Tooling side! Let’s take a look at what we achieved on Business Central?</p><h3>Business Central</h3><p>KIE (Knowledge Is Everything) is an umbrella brand offering a complete portfolio of solutions for business automation. It contains a group of related projects, including Drools (business rule management system), jBPM (a flexible Business Process Management Suite), and OptaPlanner (constraint solver).</p><p>The web tooling to interface and integrate with those projects is called Business Central: a web UI to author, manage and track business rules and processes.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what our team delivered in this area.</p><h4>High Availability</h4><p>Some weeks ago, KIE Foundation Team achieved a significant milestone: Build a cloud friendly-production-ready HA infrastructure for jBPM, Drools, and Optaplanner tooling (Business Central).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sw4AdRCOHLbDVS51" /></figure><p>This journey, targeting a fail safe infrastructure of Business Central, required a refactoring and redesign of some pieces of our codebase, with significant changes on the filesystem, index engine, distribution of events, and on Business Central UI. Still, in the end, we are delighted with the result, seeing Business Central running smoothly on a clustered environment (especially on OpenShift). Take a look at the <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/business-central-high-availability-b2d55fb33ffd">full blog post</a>.</p><h3>Streamline the Dev Workflow on Business Central</h3><p>Based on feedback from our community, one of our main goals in BC this year was to enhance the developer workflow for rules/BPM. In that area we delivered:</p><p><strong>Git Hooks Samples</strong></p><p>Some cool <a href="http://porcelli.me/rhba/business-central/git/githook/integration/push/2018/12/06/business-central-git-hook-push.html">examples</a> to make it easier for you to automate git workflows via git hooks. You should take it a <a href="http://porcelli.me/rhba/business-central/git/githook/integration/push/2018/12/06/business-central-git-hook-push.html">look</a>.</p><p><strong>Git Hooks Execution Feedback Messages</strong></p><p>Based on your feedback on our git hooks integration, we included a way to customize your messages on script execution.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HJC8sZ3PccErEl847gxMJw.gif" /></figure><p>Business Central now provides a mechanism to enable users getting feedback about the git hooks execution using customized messages based on the hook exit code.</p><p><strong>SSH Keystore</strong></p><p>To provide better automation on our platform, we delivered in Business Central an SSH Keystore. This means that users can store their public keys inside the workbench and use them to authenticate their automation scripts via ssh keys.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4dXl0KBraPX13qg_ZV-Vmg.gif" /></figure><p><strong>Contributors on Business Central</strong></p><p>We’ve created three roles integrated directly into spaces and projects (Contributor/Admin/Owner). These roles allow you to fine-tune the permissions on your spaces and projects, and soon this will deprecate Security Permissions for spaces and projects. Take a look at the full <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/contributors-on-business-central-c3f9647f378a">blog post</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*h8xkFmqlHsB21shi" /></figure><p><strong>Role-Based Access Control for Branches</strong></p><p>Built upon Contributors feature, we are proud to release role-based access branches on Business Central.</p><p>With this new feature, we provided a new UI on project settings to allow users to restrict the access for a target branch for a specific collaborator type. This is pretty useful for instance when you want to freeze a release branch for some roles. Take a look at the demo:</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZNh5mELLZF4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZNh5mELLZF4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZNh5mELLZF4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/51c20774788b8f3f1b66873492ee5c8d/href">https://medium.com/media/51c20774788b8f3f1b66873492ee5c8d/href</a></iframe><p><strong>Import specific branches on Business Central</strong></p><p>Sometimes you don’t want to import all the branches from your repo. We made it possible to import just some specific branches from your repo.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FgaWpOTGuilA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgaWpOTGuilA&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FgaWpOTGuilA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/fe8a4c2ab50829bb286e48daa880cfa3/href">https://medium.com/media/fe8a4c2ab50829bb286e48daa880cfa3/href</a></iframe><p><strong>Speed up the Developer Workflow</strong></p><p>As I already mentioned, one of our goals was to enhance the developer workflow for rules/BPM. And we included on BC two things that we believe will be game-changers for those developers who work with Business Central on a daily basis.</p><p>The first feature was the ‘Build and Install’ button on authoring. This allows users to do a build on their projects without the need for a deploy.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V-C-F3wwHJEKyK1Dvhb52w.gif" /></figure><p>The second valuable addition was that we created two new Decision/Process Server Modes. DEVELOPMENT (the new default) and PRODUCTION that (Blocks “-SNAPSHOT” deployment).</p><p>These changes will allow users to quickly build, deploy our projects, making it easier (and saving many clicks) to test their changes on Kie Server while we can preserve the production consistency. First, let’s take a look at our production mode.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6KOEvnhn2uNbJl3TFp8fGQ.gif" /></figure><h4>Workspace collaboration via change requests</h4><p>We also included a cool new feature targeting business central collaboration: Change Requests support between Business Central branches.</p><p>This new workflow allows users to submit their changes for approval from one branch to another, as well as the ability to review the changes prior to the integration.</p><p>See details about this feature on this <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/workspace-collaboration-via-change-requests-65b5fe96564e">post</a> and a sneak peek on this video:</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FvlC89jL1RL8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvlC89jL1RL8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FvlC89jL1RL8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/a1197f673956c21eaa589f3abaf439cb/href">https://medium.com/media/a1197f673956c21eaa589f3abaf439cb/href</a></iframe><h4>Form modeler support for class models from external dependencies</h4><p>We created a way to allow users to load models from external dependencies on forms. This allows us to generate forms for processes that use classes from external dependencies (not created on the same project with Data Modeler but that are added as dependencies of the project).</p><h4>Upload of multiple documents for human task forms</h4><p>We created in the forms designer a widget called “Document Collection”. It enables you to upload multiple documents to a process or task form. You can also use the “Document Collection” widget for process or task forms that have a variable with the type `org.jbpm.document.DocumentCollection`. Additionally, it also supports the legacy type `org.jbpm.document.Documents`.</p><h4>Importing and exporting Dashbuilder data</h4><p>On Business Central 7.25 (August) 7.25 we added a feature that allows users to import and export all data related to Dashbuilder: Datasets, Perspectives, and Navigation.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7YXS7iioUhFO6w8DDXY6wg.gif" /></figure><h4>CSS Editor on Form Builder</h4><p>We also created a cool new CSS Editor on our Form Builder. Take a look on your demo:</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FdsZn84UdsWE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdsZn84UdsWE&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FdsZn84UdsWE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/6f51268f6615036bf58693827c98fcdd/href">https://medium.com/media/6f51268f6615036bf58693827c98fcdd/href</a></iframe><h4>React components in Red Hat Business Central</h4><p>We also created a way to write Business Central components based on React. Take a look at the full <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/introducing-appformer-js-react-components-on-red-hat-business-central-f38fc9701db9">blog post</a>.</p><h4>Business Central Brand Consolidation</h4><p>To consolidate and promote better our technology stack, since 7.18 version we consolidated and rebranded the workbenches to a single distribution called to <strong>Business Central</strong> (accessible via /business-central). Take a look at this <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/workbench-consolidation-and-profiles-7f6ee0ef401">post</a> to do a deep dive on this migration.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Fsrwwe-MBNUWlyrt" /></figure><h4>Offline Charts</h4><p>The Dashbuilder default chart implementation was replaced from Google Charts to <a href="https://c3js.org/">C3.js</a>. The main reason behind this move is to allow our users to use Business Central in an offline environment (Google Charts requires internet connection).</p><h4>UX improvements</h4><p>With the excellent collaboration from the UX team, we are able to improve a lot of Business Central UX. Some highlights:</p><p><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AF-2176"><strong>AF-2176</strong></a><strong> — Error messages need to be able to be copied</strong></p><p>In the past, error messages often overrun the size of the field on the bottom of the web page. The only way to read them was hovering over the field and there was no way to copy the text of a message. We fixed this formatting the error message and also adding a copy button that copies all the errors on CSV format.</p><p><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AF-2244"><strong>AF-2244</strong></a><strong> — UX support/guidance after new deployment</strong></p><p>After deploying a new project, the user is now able to ‘View deployment details’ with a useful link.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Je-5h3I60Sr1HCJLZfFqfw.gif" /></figure><p><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AF-2151"><strong>AF-2151</strong></a><strong> — Modify asset Save button behavior and presentation</strong></p><p>Instead of asking the user every time to add a comment to the file commit on the Save action, we now provide a split button with the primary (default) option being simply Save the file, with no dialog presented before saving — streamlining the dev workflow.</p><p>If the user wants to comment on the save operation, he/she can still rely on our new option “Save with comments”, that will be presented with a dialog asking for the file save the comment.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*G8eGw9lkWnZU165QVZAHIQ.gif" /></figure><p><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AF-2214"><strong>AF-2214</strong></a><strong> — User confirmation when closing the workbench with unsaved stuff</strong></p><p>If the user had unsaved changes and closed the browser, then they would lose all changes without being warned about it. Thus, as a last resort, after this PR the browser will ask the user for confirmation when closing the tab, closing the browser or refreshing the page.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce a fresh new <a href="https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.2.0">Kogito Tooling release </a>that includes a major milestone for our team — the DMN support for VSCode and GitHub Chrome extension.</p><p>We also added some important enhancements to our GitHub Chrome Extension. Now users will be able to not just edit but also visualize DMN/BPMN diagrams — what is especially cool on Pull Request reviews.</p><p>First, as always, let’s take a look at the demo! Please pay special attention to the pull request workflow.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZjzlhOWBPSc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZjzlhOWBPSc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZjzlhOWBPSc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/d4574a44fdddf8e2ad2e003e17008c69/href">https://medium.com/media/d4574a44fdddf8e2ad2e003e17008c69/href</a></iframe><p>Awesome isn’t it? Alex Porcelli wrote a detailed post about how this feature is a game changer to the BPMN/DMN developer workflow. Take a look on his <a href="https://porcelli.me/announcement/tooling/github/bpmn/dmn/2019/10/22/bpmn-dmn-github-extension.html">blog</a>.</p><h3>Decision Model and Notation Support</h3><p>With a great collaboration of the Drools Tooling team (with highlights for the impressive work of Michael Anstis, Gabriele Cardosi and Guilherme Carreiro Gomes) we reached a major milestone on Kogito tooling. Now you will be able to create your DMN files inside your VSCode and on GitHub Chrome Extension.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*3r9A4CX3rRnNYOlF" /></figure><h3>Chrome Extension New Features</h3><p>As promised in the last post, we also added on this release two new major improvements on our Chrome Extension. The ability to visualize the BPMN/DMN diagram on any repo (not only on editing) and also a great integration to the GitHub PR review mechanism.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MJd64O7h_C4zc7cJ" /></figure><p>You are now able to not only visualize the current diagram but if you click on the original button, you will be able to see the current state of the file in the repository. We hope that this will be helpful to review your models directly on the GitHub Pull Request in the same way you do for any source code.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When editing a file directly on GitHub’s interface and committing it, GitHub takes a while to make the new file available on raw.githubusercontent.com. Since that’s where we fetch the files from, you might see outdated versions for a while. Don’t panic! After a few moments the files will be in sync.</p><h3>But how to install this?</h3><p>Ok, this is cool but how to install it? Look at the instructions on our blog posts: <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/bpmn-chrome-extension-released-alpha-abe89676d76">How to setup the extension on Chrome Extension</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/bpmn-vscode-extension-released-alpha-1782ddaa2a4e">How to set up the extension on VSCode</a>. Soon we will make this process more straight forward publishing on Chrome and VSCode extension store.</p><h3>What’s Next</h3><p>As you may have realised, we have big plans for our kogito tooling. Soon, we will hope to release another game-changing tool for you! Stay tuned!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d001b0c2793e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/kogito-tooling-release-dmn-support-and-chrome-extension-prs-visualization-d001b0c2793e">Kogito Tooling Release: DMN support and Chrome Extension PRs visualization</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation">kie-tooling</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is new on Business Central, from Foundation Team perspective — June 2019</h3><p>Recently, we pushed a lot of cool new features on Business Central added by Foundation Team. Those features will be soon available on 7.23 release.</p><p>This post will do a quick overview of those. I hope you guys enjoy!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xOAgJ37QMV45ykpt" /></figure><h3>Role Based Access Control for Branches</h3><p>Built upon <a href="https://medium.com/kie-foundation/contributors-on-business-central-c3f9647f378a">Contributors feature</a>, we are proud to release role-based access branches on Business Central.</p><p>With this new feature, we will provide a new UI on project settings in order to allow users to restrict the access for a target branch for a specific collaborator type. This is pretty useful for instance when you want to freeze a release branch for some roles. Take a look at the demo:</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZNh5mELLZF4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZNh5mELLZF4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZNh5mELLZF4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/51c20774788b8f3f1b66873492ee5c8d/href">https://medium.com/media/51c20774788b8f3f1b66873492ee5c8d/href</a></iframe><p>Keep in mind that for now, the security check is using both sources (Security Management screen and contributors) to grant or deny permissions to spaces and projects (Inclusive OR). One example of this is where the user has the security permission to update a project and/or has write permission on that branch (based on the contributor type), then he or she will be able to create new assets. These are our security configurations for this demo:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tqC_DCUFWaO9t2pT" /></figure><h3>Import specific branches on Business Central</h3><p>Sometimes you don’t want to import all the branches from your repo and now it’s possible to import just what you want:</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FgaWpOTGuilA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgaWpOTGuilA&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FgaWpOTGuilA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/fe8a4c2ab50829bb286e48daa880cfa3/href">https://medium.com/media/fe8a4c2ab50829bb286e48daa880cfa3/href</a></iframe><p>Keep in mind that master branch is mandatory for Business Central.</p><h3>Form modeler support for class models from external dependencies</h3><p>With this <a href="https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-wb-common/pull/2525">PR</a> from Pere, we are able to load on forms models from external dependencies. This allows us to generate forms for processes that use classes from external dependencies (not created on the same project with Data Modeler but that are added as dependencies of the project).</p><p>This change also fixes an issue on DMO when resolving the TypeSource from external DO.</p><h3>Upload of multiple documents for human task forms</h3><p>A new widget called “Document Collection” is available in the forms designer. It enables you to upload multiple documents to a process or task form. You can also use the “Document Collection” widget for process or task forms that have a variable with the type `org.jbpm.document.DocumentCollection`. Additionally, it also supports the legacy type `org.jbpm.document.Documents`.</p><h3>Dashbuilder C3 Charts extended support and Drop GCharts</h3><p>We just reached C3 full feature compatibility with our old GCharts renderer and from now on, Business Central uses a new API for chart rendering based on C3 and D3.</p><p>The C3 Renderer API is now used by default and implements all features from the previous chart library, Google Charts. The Google Charts library is now deprecated and removed from BC due to some implementation issues (non-open source and also requires online access). To revert it to Google Charts, build it from sources and add it to Business Central (see the `README.md` file in `dashbuilder-renderer-google` repository), and then set the renderer system property to `org.dashbuilder.renderer.default=gwtcharts`.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*UgnUndWqOrC-4rTc" /></figure><h3>CSS Editor on Form Builder</h3><p>We also included a cool new CSS Editor on our Form Builder.
