Some past and current raw notes of my R&D and discoveries related to Systems Design.

Currently I'm reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems](./designing-data-intensive-applications/) from  Martin Kleppmann and taking the [Grokking The System Design Interview](./grokking-the-system-design-interview) course at educative.io.
