After writing a simple pong game, as I mentioned in my last post, I'm still studying Go. This week I challenged myself to write a more exciting thing, so I decided to write a Go program that controls a Stardew Valley[^1] game :-)

I found this tiny lib that helped my program to trigger keyboard events: https://github.com/micmonay/keybd_event. It's a pretty straightforward lib, however, I noticed it had an issue with macOS, and I could help with the fix I get my first Go PR merged ðŸŽ‰

I could solve my initial challenge in less than one hour, and it didn't seem hard enough. So I spent some time making enhancements, and I could make tweets control my Stardew Valley game.

It works by consuming the Twitter Streaming API - of course, it's still super simple, but the result is fun, see:

Even with this cool video, personally, the most rewarding part in this small project was to get my PR on [keybd_event](https://github.com/micmonay/keybd_event) lib merged :-) It's always rewarding to contribute in OS projects.
