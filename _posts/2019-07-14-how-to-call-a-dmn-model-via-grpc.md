Some days ago, I shared my impressions about gRPC and how I see it as an appealing alternative, compared to the HTTP/1.1 + JSON standard.

Today I'd like to share this repository:
[https://github.com/karreiro/kie-grpc](https://github.com/karreiro/kie-grpc)

[![Demo](/assets/dmn-grpc-demo.gif "Demo")](/assets/dmn-grpc-demo.gif)

It has a naive implementation of a Go application calling a DMN engine.

I hope you enjoy it :-)
