<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week or Uniform Resource Locator of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL for you :-)

This week the winner is **fireflowers - The Rust Programming Language, in the words of its practitioners**:
[brson.github.io/fireflowers](http://brson.github.io/fireflowers).

If you want to know more about Rust or believe it wouldnâ€™t ever be appropriate to the kind of problem you solve, maybe you should give this link a try.

I hope you change or mind (or not!) :-)
