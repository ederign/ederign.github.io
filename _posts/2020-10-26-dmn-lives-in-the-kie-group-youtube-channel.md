The [KIE YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUjeymTM-TrwHs36388VRbw) is regularly posting quite interesting content!

Last week I had the pleasure of presenting a talk about DMN at the **KieLive#11** session:

Tomorrow (October 27th), [Edson Tirelli](https://blog.kie.org/all?search_authors=33) will also talk about DMN, but from a different and more advanced perspective at the **KieLive#12**:

I’ve just activated the YouTube reminder because I won’t miss it.

Joy there as well :-)
