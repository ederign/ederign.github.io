We have just launched a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! üéâ On the 0.9.1 [release](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.9.1), we made a lot of improvements and bug fixes.

We are also happy to announce the MVP of our DMN Runner and many enhancements on Custom Task support on BPMN.

This post will give a quick overview of this release and add some highlights of our [0.9.0](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.9.0) release. I hope you enjoy it!

### Custom Task Support Enhancement on BPMN

We made many improvements regarding custom task support on BPMN, especially related to compatibility with Business Central projects.

Stay tuned that soon we will publish a blog post with a deep dive into these enhancements.

### BPMN Editor - Read-Only mode

We introduced read-only mode support for our BPMN Editors. This feature is handy when you embed our editors using our [standalone editors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kogito-tooling/kie-editors-standalone).

 Simple pass 'readOnly:true' in our editor startup to activate this mode (it also works for DMN). You can also see this new mode in action in our [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bpmn-dmn-test-scenario-ed/mgkfehibfkdpjkfjbikpchpcfimepckf):

### Augmenting the developer experience with DMN Runner

We‚Äôve been exploring ways to augment the developer experience for the Business Modeler Editors. In the spirit of ‚Äúrelease early, release often‚Äù and MVPs, we‚Äôd like to share an early stage of a running prototype of the DMN Runner so that we can gather more feedback.

You can watch the presentation of this prototype in [KIE Live#31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMnGDgVUwHQ&ab_channel=KIE) or try it out in our [staging](https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online-staging/dmn-runner) environment. Soon we will publish a post with more details.

I would like to also recommend the recent article from [Yeser](https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/how-to-use-test-scenario-editor-to-test-your-dmn-asset-in-vscode.html). He provides a complete step-by-step tutorial to use Test Scenario Editor to test your DMN assets on VS Code and also, this [article](https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/how-the-new-feel-code-completion-works-under-the-hoods.html) from Guilherme where he details how the new Feel code completion works under the hood.
