<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week or Uniform Resource Locator of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL for you :-)

This week the winner is **The System Design Primer**:
[https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).

If you're reviewing your system design skills, this is a must-read repository for you :-)

I hope you enjoy it!
