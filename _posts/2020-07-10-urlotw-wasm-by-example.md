<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week or Uniform Resource Locator of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL for you :-)

This week the winner is **Wasm By Example**:
[wasmbyexample.dev](https://wasmbyexample.dev).

[![Wasm By Example website](/assets/wasm-by-example.png "Wasm By Example website")](/assets/wasm-by-example.png)

Right now, Iâ€™m getting more and more involved with WASM, and I got a fun time checking Wasm By Example, which is an excellent hands-on introduction to WebAssembly with a lot of snippets, examples, and simple programs.

I hope you enjoy it too :-)
