<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week or Uniform Resource Locator of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL for you :-)

This week the winner is **Build your own (insert technology here)**:
https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x

I've discovered a bunch of interesting weekend projects there!

I hope you enjoy it ;-)
