<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week or Uniform Resource Locator of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL for you :-)

This week the winner is **_Learn Go with test-driven development_** ([https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests)).

It's is a super engaging tutorial, and I cannot stop reading it. It teaches you simple and every-day-Go-APIs by using TDD (it looks dull when I say, but it's not).

I hope you enjoy it ;-)
