Last month, we released a new piece of our tooling strategy, the Business Modeler Hub Preview. A single place where you are just one click away from all our tooling channels.

The Hub is [available](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases) on all platforms: Linux, Windows, and macOS. You can also download it via the Business Modeler [website](https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online/#/).

## Business Modeler Hub Preview
Currently, Business Modeler Hub Preview aggregates four tools for your easy access:
* Kogito VS Code extension: where you can automatically install our extension on VS Code and launch it with only two clicks;
* Kogito GitHub extension for Chrome: where you can install the Kogito extension to an existing version of Chrome;
* Business Modeler Desktop Preview: where you can launch the desktop version of Business Modeler Preview;
* Business Modeler Preview: where you can quickly go to the Online Modeler Preview site.

## Thank you to everyone involved!
I want to thank everyone involved with this new tool, from the KIE Tooling Team Engineers to the lifesavers QEs and the UX people that help us look awesome!
