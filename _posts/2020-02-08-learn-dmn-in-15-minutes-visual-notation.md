Last week I mentioned the [Learn DMN in 15 minutes](http://learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com). I created it inspired by the many other tutorials, and by the Machine Learning course that Iâ€™m taking.

DMN is an excellent standard, but it has a gap in tutorials that guide your first steps on it. So, this initiative aims to cover this phase.

I just finished the **[Introduction](http://learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com/learn/introduction)** and the **[Visual notation](http://learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com/learn/visual-notation)** sections.

Thus, feel free to take a look and leave some feedback :-)
