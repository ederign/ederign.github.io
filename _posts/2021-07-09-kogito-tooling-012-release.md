We have just launched a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! üéâ On the 0.12.0 [release](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.12.0), we made a lot of improvements and bug fixes. We are also happy to announce that this release marks the first iteration of our 'DMN deploy on OpenShift' feature, and also we have a lot of improvements on our DMN and BPMN Editors.

This post will give a quick overview of this [release](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.12.0). I hope you enjoy it!

### Deploy decisions to DMN Developer Sandbox on dmn.new

We just launched in our dmn.new environment a feature that allows you to quickly deploy decision models to the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift.

This feature is super cool, and I invite you to give it a try. You can also check more details on this blog [post](https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/deploy-decisions-to-dmn-developer-sandbox.html).

### DMN nodes are not created on top of the selected node

DMN diagrams are generally vertical (whereas BPMN is horizontal). When adding a "Decision Node" from a "DMN Input Data,‚Äù for better usability, now the nodes are created on top of the selected node.

### DMN support for bend-points on connectors

We also added support for bend-points on the DMN diagram that are pretty useful, especially on Complex DMN diagrams.

See this [blog post](https://blog.kie.org/2021/07/bend-points-and-the-dmn-editor.html) for more details.

### Line splicing for BPMN and DMN editors

Line splicing is a new feature that allows dropping an existing node on top of a connector and automatically split it into two new connectors. This was included in both our DMN and BPMN editors.

Soon we will publish a blog post with a detailed description of this feature.

### Resize control points improvements

We made many improvements on resizing control points for our BPMN and DMN editor, including changing the resize icon and modifying how magnets react on a resize.

### Support for process metadata attributes

We also added a new AdvancedData that allows users to add generic metadata to all node types and event types in the BPMN editor.
