We just launched a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! üéâ

On the [0.8.0](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.8.0) release, we made a lot of improvements and bug fixes. This post will do a quick overview of those. I hope you enjoy it!

## Kogito Tooling Examples Update!

We‚Äôre happy to announce a big update on the Kogito Tooling Examples in order to help you understand how to use and integrate the Kogito Tooling packages on your project!

The examples can be accessed here, the source code lives in this repository and you can follow this series of blog posts guiding you through them.

## BPMN and DMN Standalone Editors

We also published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kogito-tooling/kie-editors-standalone) the alpha version of our BPMN and DMN Standalone Editors. Now it‚Äôs super easy to embed our editors in your own applications:

See the full [blog post](https://blog.kie.org/2020/10/bpmn-and-dmn-standalone-editors.html) for details.

## DMN ‚Äî Multiple Decision Requirement Diagrams

The [DMN editor](http://dmn.new/) was already great for expressing business logic and decomposing complex decisions into multiple nodes.

On 0.7.0, we introduced tech preview support for Multiple DRDs. On 0.7.1, we delivered the last bit of this important feature. Check this [post](http://karreiro.com/2020/10/13/dmn-editor-supports-multiple-diagrams-now.html) to understand this feature in detail.

## Update Gist on Online Modeler

We also included in this version a small but important tweak on Online Modeler. Now you can create gists and also update them!

## Kogito Tooling i18n Infrastructure

On the 0.7.1 release, we introduced a generic API for i18n in all the channels. Soon, editors will use this API to implement internationalization on all editors! Stay tuned.


## Fixed issues and improvements

We also made a lot of refactorings and improvements, especially to allow our internal API‚Äôs extendability.
