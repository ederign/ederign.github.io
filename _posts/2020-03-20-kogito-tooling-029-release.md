We are happy to announce a fresh Kogito Tooling release!

On this [release](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases), we did a lot of improvements and bug fixes. We progressed a lot on the DMN/BPMN Editors, delivered a brand new UX for the Online Editor and also improved a lot the ‚Äònative‚Äô experience of VSCode.

Another important milestone achieved is the first experimental release of our extension with the of the new [VSCode Custom webview proposed API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77131). In order to give it a try, you will need to download the latest version of VSCode (1.43.0), install the specific extension (vscode_extension_kogito_kie_editors_0.2.8-new-webview-api-release.vsix) and run it with the following command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ederign/401eb69852a6d6d7c5c2dfd90ebd0c36.js"></script>

In case you don‚Äôt want to run VSCode in proposed API mode, for now, we are still packing vscode_extension_kogito_kie_editors_0.2.8.vsix. Included on this release:
