**Good practices** -- this certainly is the most important and challenging topic when you're learning a new language. That's natural. You're a beginner, didn't read much code, it's hard to decide the right way for expressing some piece of logic.

Static code analyzers and formatters play an essential role in such a controversial topic.  Luckily, in the Go language, we have the `gofmt` to format our source code and keep most of the Go libraries with a homogenous codebase.

Unfortunately, code analyzers and formatters have their limitations and don't cover everything.

As you probably know, Iâ€™ve been studying Go in the last six or seven weeks. Even so, the following article is the most valuable resource I could read about Go good practices: [Clean Go Code - github.com/Pungyeon/clean-go-article](https://github.com/Pungyeon/clean-go-article).

It fills many topics that I needed to search by myself and also taught me new things. If you're studying the language, this article is my recommendation for your week. Have a nice read! :-)
