<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week or Uniform Resource Locator of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL for you :-)

This week the winner is **Custom game engines: A Small Study**:
[gist.github.com/raysan5/909dc6cf33ed40223eb0dfe625c0de74](https://gist.github.com/raysan5/909dc6cf33ed40223eb0dfe625c0de74).

Everyone that deals with technology already thought about making their own game. This study gives some perspective about how the size of a project and the type of game impact on the technological choice.

It's an interesting study. I hope you enjoy it!
