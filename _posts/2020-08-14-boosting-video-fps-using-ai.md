These days I was spending some time on YouTube when I faced this incredible video, and I really want to share it with you:

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFN9dzw0qH8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

When I finished it, I was already stunned, but then I found these other even more impressive videos: [sites.google.com/view/wenbobao/dain](https://sites.google.com/view/wenbobao/dain). It engaged me in understanding how that works.

If you've got curious like me, you can check the project's source code [here](https://github.com/baowenbo/DAIN).

I've not finished reading the paper yet, but it is quite interesting to understand the mechanism behind this kind of project.

I hope you like it as well! :-)
