We have just launched a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! ðŸŽ‰ On the 0.11.0 [release](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.11.0), we made a lot of improvements and bug fixes. We are also happy to announce that this release marks the first release of our DMN Runner on [dmn.new](https://dmn.new/)!

This post will give a quick overview of this [release](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.11.0). I hope you enjoy it!

### Instantaneous Feedback Loop for DMN Authoring with DMN Runner

Weâ€™ve been exploring ways to augment the developer experience for our editors on the KIE Tooling team. Today, I'm proud to announce the release of our DMN Runner on dmn.new. We hope it will transform your DMN Authoring experience. Letâ€™s see it in action:

For this reason, we decided to start a new development stream for our BPMN, DMN, and Scenario Simulator editors called [Kogito Editors](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-editors-java/), freeing the way for Editors to continue evolving on both streams separately (Kogito and BC) without carrying the weight of the other.

Soon we will write a blog post describing this new awesome feature.
