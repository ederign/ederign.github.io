<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week or Uniform Resource Locator of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL for you :-)

This week the winner is **Build Superhuman Reinforcement Learning in 10 Minutes**:
[ericvanular.com/build-superhuman-RL-in-10-min](https://ericvanular.com/build-superhuman-RL-in-10-min/).

It's cool how good results we can achieve with a naive but well-polished reinforcement learning implementation. The article above summarizes a nice and very quick example :-)

I hope you enjoy it!
