<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week or Uniform Resource Locator of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL for you :-)

This week the winner is **Learn DMN in 15 minutes**:
[learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com](http://learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com).

Last Wednesday, I finally finished the last section for this course. It was the first time Iâ€™ve created something like that, so I kindly invite you to take a look and give me some feedback.

DMN is already simple and easy to understand at first glance. However, new adopters generally want to check a quick overview and learn about the most important parts, before jumping on a more in-depth journey. That's the goal of this course!

I hope you enjoy it :-)
