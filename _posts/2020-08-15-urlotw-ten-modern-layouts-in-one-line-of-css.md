<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week or Uniform Resource Locator of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL for you :-)

This week the winner is **Ten modern layouts in one line of CSS**:
[web.dev/one-line-layouts](https://web.dev/one-line-layouts).

[![Ten modern layouts in one line of CSS website](/assets/ten-modern-layouts-in-one-line-of-css.png "Ten modern layouts in one line of CSS website")](/assets/ten-modern-layouts-in-one-line-of-css.png)

This is one of the best CSS posts I have ever see. It’s a must-read if you write at least one line of CSS code per month ;-)

It’s a really rewarding reading. I hope you enjoy it!
