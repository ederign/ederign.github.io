Rust ecosystem is still young, but it has enough libraries and game engines to provide you en experimental game development environment (you may check more details about the Rust game development community [here](https://arewegameyet.rs)). 

Bevy is a quite simple data-driven game engine written in Rust. If you want to try it, I recommend you to check this list of [Bevy-based-projects](https://github.com/bevyengine/awesome-bevy). You may find some inspiration there to start your own! :-)
