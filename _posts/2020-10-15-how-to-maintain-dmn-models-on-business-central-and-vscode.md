Currently, the DMN editor is supported in a variety of environments. You can create a DMN model in an online editor, in a chrome extension, in a desktop app, in a VSCode extension, and even on Business Central.

Until the latest release, you could face some differences between a model created by **VSCode** and a one created by **Business Central**. Now, this post aims to demonstrate that both environments are fully compatible by showing the same project from two perspectives: **I) how to create a project on VSCode and import it on Business Central**, and **II) how to create a project on Business Central and import it on VSCode**.

Let's check both environments.

## The VSCode perspective

Let's get started to understand how to use VSCode to handle a DMN file in a context of a Business Central project by relying only on VSCode.

- In a shell prompt, enter the following `mvn` command to create a project:

```
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion=7.44.0.Final \
  -DartifactId="Some Application" \
  -DgroupId="org.kie" \
  -DartifactId="vscode-2-bc"
```

- When the archetype plug-in switches to interactive mode, accept the default values for the remaining fields

- After generating your project, create a DMN asset at the `src/main/resources/<your package>` directory and populate it with some interesting decision, like the one in the video:

- Now, initialize the git repository for your project, add all files, and commit them:

```
git init && git add . && git commit -m "Init"
```

- Use `pwd` to get the local path of your project

- Open the Business Central spaces screen, click on **Import Project**, and set `file://<the local path of your project>` as the **Repository URL**

- Done! You've successfully created a Business Central project relying only on your terminal and on your VSCode DMN editor! 🎉

## The Business Central perspective

Alright, now let's do the opposite. Let's create a project on Business Central and import it to VSCode.

- Create a project on **Business Central** in the spaces screen

- Create a DMN asset and populate it with some interesting decision, like the one in the video above

- Now, click on "Settings" to open the project settings screen

[![Setting tab screenshot](/assets/how-to-maintain-dmn-models-on-business-central-and-vscode-settings.png "Setting tab screenshot")](/assets/how-to-maintain-dmn-models-on-business-central-and-vscode-settings.png)

- Copy the HTTP URL of your project

[![Business Central repository URL screenshot](/assets/how-to-maintain-dmn-models-on-business-central-and-vscode-repo-url.png "Business Central repository URL screenshot")](/assets/how-to-maintain-dmn-models-on-business-central-and-vscode-repo-url.png)

- Clone the URL of your project
 
```
git clone http://localhost:8080/business-central/git/MySpace/bc-2-vscode
```

- Open the project directory with VSCode

- Done! You've successfully opened your Business Central project  with VSCode. You can now perform changes into your DMN mode, commit them with git, and the Business Central will automatically detect them
