Have you ever needed to handle a batch of DMN files? Or even.. have you tried to list nodes of some model by using the command-line?

Feeling this pain, Iâ€™ve created the [DMN-cli](http://dmn-cli.com) as a starting point for simple command-line operations on DMN files.

The DMN-cli is a tool that allows you to manage, inspect, and preview DMN models easily. You can check the repository [here](https://github.com/karreiro/dmn-cli). Contributions and suggestions are more than welcome :-)
