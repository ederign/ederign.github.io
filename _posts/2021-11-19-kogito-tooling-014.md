We have just launched a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! ðŸŽ‰ On the 0.14.1 [release](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.14.1), we made a lot of improvements and bug fixes.

This post will give a quick overview of our most recent [releases](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases). I hope you enjoy it!

### Don't miss the KIE live next week

Our beloved .new environment will receive a massive update! Dealing with complex models and collaborating with others will become much easier.

Join us on the 23rd of November in the next [KIE Live presentation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUjeymTM-TrwHs36388VRbw) for a walkthrough of the new features and new integrations we have with the Developersâ€™ most beloved tools.

### 10k+ users of VS Code BPMN Extension

Our [BPMN extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-extension-bpmn-editor) just reached an important milestone on VS Code Store: 10k+ individual installs! Congrats to Roger (tech lead) and all the BPMN/Stunner team.

### Automatically Generate BPMN/DMN SVG on VS Code

To provide better integration with the KIE server and Business Central, on the Kogito Tooling 0.14 release, we introduced a way to, on VS Code, automatically generate SVG on each save of your BPMN and DMN Diagram. Take a look at this feature in action:

Please take a look at this [blog post](https://blog.kie.org/2021/11/automatically-generate-bpmn-dmn-svg-on-vs-code.html) for further details!

### DashBuilder Runtime released on Kogito tooling

We are glad to announce that we are releasing [DashBuilder Runtime 0.14.1 Alpha](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.14.1)! The major change for this new release is the adoption of Quarkus as the backend for DashBuilder Runtime and the introduction of DashBuilder Authoring, a new tool to create dashboards.

From now on, we will also follow the Kogito Tooling release cadence! Soon we will publish a blog post with more details!

### Canvas API

We also just released the first iteration of a [JS / TS API](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/blob/9bc4b7a87282dd808cc7a3a4267f865e4ad849ed/packages/kie-editors-standalone/README.md) for node manipulation in our editors. This new API allows to manipulate the shapes in the canvas, so third parties can play with the different objects in the canvas

### Visualize, Edit, and Share your BPMN, DMN, and PMML with github.dev

Some weeks ago, GitHub released github.dev which allows you to open any repository in VS Code directly from your browser just pressing . (dot key) on it. On Kogito Tooling 0.13.0 release, we updated our VS Code BPMN, DMN, and PMML extension to also work on this innovative environment. Check it out:
