We just launched a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! üéâ
On [0.6.1](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/tag/0.6.1) release, we made a lot of improvements and bug fixes. This post will do a quick overview of those. I hope you enjoy it!

## Kogito Tooling CI Improvements

Since the beginning of the project, we have been using GitHub Actions to [build](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/pull/246/checks) kogito tooling repositories, but last week we added three significant improvements for our CI/CD on this release.

## Daily builds of our kogito tooling

Some days ago, we started doing an automatic daily release of the kogito tooling. The daily build of the Business Modeler can be accessed on this [link](https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online/dev/#/) and other artifacts (VS Code, Desktop, Hub, and Chrome Extension) can be downloaded in the latest [‚ÄúPublish daily dev version‚Äù](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+daily+dev+version%22) job. This is a nice feature to try the latest master features of kogito tooling! üöÄ

## Business Modeler build for each PR

Also, to improve tests and code review processes, now for each PR on kogito-tooling instead of just generating the build artifacts, we are also providing a live version of Business Modeler.
To access the Business Modeler for a job fired by a PR in kogito-tooling, you can use https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online-ci/pull/<PR_NUMBER>
To access the Business Modeler for a job fired by a comment in the kogito-tooling issue, you can use https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online-ci/comment/<COMMENT_ID>

## Build RHPAM Editors on kogito tooling actions

The BPMN, DMN, and Scesim editors used on Kogito are based on RHPAM editors that live on kie-wb-common and drools-wb Java-based repositories.
Another significant improvement that we did on this release is kogito-tooling GitHub Actions to do a full build on RHPAM editors and generate an integrated artifact (kogito tooling + editors from Java repositories).
Now, it‚Äôs just a matter of the author of a PR in kogito-tooling using a branch with the same name in his/her fork that contains changes in any editor (BPMN, DMN, or SceSim). As soon this happens, the ‚ÄúPull Request CI ‚Äî Full Downstream‚Äù job will run and produce a build of the VS Code extension, Business Modeler, Chrome Extension, and Desktop with the modified editors for faster testing.
But how should I build kogito tooling, if my editor change doesn‚Äôt affect the kogito tooling repository? Go to the pinned issue on the kogito-tooling repo and create a new comment following the format ‚ÄúBuild: {github-username}/{branch-name}‚Äù.

[![Build](/assets/2020/build.png "Build")](/assets/2020/build.png)

In my opinion, those three improvements are a huge step forward for us. First, they will speed up a lot of our code review process and build, and, most important, it‚Äôs a big step forward in the path to continuous delivery of our lovely Business Modeler.

## Kogito Tooling i18n

We‚Äôre happy to announce that Kogito Tooling is ready to be internationalized! This means that it will be possible to change the locale and access the Kogito Tooling Channels‚Äô translations.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ljmotta/4a3533c1907593ea0046222c577ca77b.js"></script>

We developed an i18n type-safe library with React usability in mind to enable this new feature, which allows simple and easy integration with an already existing project. See the full details on this blog post.

## Page Support on OmniChannel Architecture

Since its inception, OmniChannel allowed us to run the same editor code in multiple channels without changing the codebase. Now we enhance this architecture also to support Pages and Components.

This new architectural component will enable many new use cases, as an example showing runtime screens, dashboards, etc. Stay tuned that soon we will launch a blog post and some examples of how to use it.

## Auto start property for ad-hoc subprocess

We also added add ‚ÄúAuto Start‚Äù property to Adhoc sub-process properties panel, which is currently supported by the Kogito runtime via metadata.
