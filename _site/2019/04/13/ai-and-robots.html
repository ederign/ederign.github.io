      <p>Some years ago I frequented mastering classes at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP). UNICAMP is an excellent university, and I was living very close to the campus, so I decided to have a different kind of <em>happy hour</em> for some months and learn about Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>The AI class (focused on robotic practices) explored very diverse topics like electronic components, AI algorithms, and techniques to apply all the theory we learned in the <em>real world</em>, which full of new challenging circumstances.</p>

<p>I want to share with you this demo, which is one of the projects that I could work in this class:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQ_KEVNSUXE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<hr />

<p>The main topics I presented in this video are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FuzzyLogic - the FuzzyLogic controls the intensity of the power that the wheel joint needs to move the robot to the correct direction;</li>
  <li>Pathfinding Algorithm - the algorithm helps the robot to calculate the correct trajectory to achieve the desired goal;</li>
  <li>Extended Kalman filter - this theory helps the robot to estimate its current location in the room;</li>
  <li>Robotic components - the kinematic model and the components of the robot are essential topics and impact in the implementation of the algorithms;</li>
  <li>V-REP simulator - this simulator required a Java and Lua integration to make the simulation work with the algorithms written in Java.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was an exciting project, but I was shy about the code base, so I decided to keep it private when I worked on this. But today I’ve realized how cool this project is, so I’m sharing it with you. Feel free to check the code <a href="https://github.com/karreiro/final-project">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/karreiro/pathfinding-lab">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you’re feeling inspired to learn about robotics. It can be as simple or as complex as you want, so have fun! :-)</p>
