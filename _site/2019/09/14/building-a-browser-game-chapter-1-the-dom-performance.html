      <p>These days I was feeling nostalgic about JavaScript. My adventures with Go has been fun, but I was missing to write some code that runs on the browser and makes colorful-things pop. Also, I had an exciting idea, and I decided to make it happen with a web app.</p>

<p>Summarising, I’ll try to build a tower defense game browser-based with crafting mechanics. I’m taking it as a relaxing project. So, I’m not rushing with it, and I’m trying to enjoy each challenge slowly.</p>

<p>I’ve decided not to implement the game on canvas. DOM API is so rich that I’ve decided to try it. However, I was expecting some delays to render complex structures, so my first challenge was to validate an approach to render a big bunch of blocks.</p>

<p>⚠️ I limited the resources of my machine to record the following GIFs and make them more expressive, so they run faster in the <em>“real world”</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s the first try (notice how slow!):</p>

<p><a href="/assets/dom-performance-first-try.gif"><img src="/assets/dom-performance-first-try.gif" alt="First try" title="First try" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s the second try. Tried some optmizations by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> to give some idea of progress:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/dom-performance-second-try.gif"><img src="/assets/dom-performance-second-try.gif" alt="Second try" title="Second try" /></a></p>

<p>And.. finally the best that I could achive until now, where I’m rendering only <strong>visible</strong> elements:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/dom-performance-third-try.gif"><img src="/assets/dom-performance-third-try.gif" alt="Third try" title="Third try" /></a></p>

<p>I’m not entirely confident about using this DOM-based approach. However, I’m going to develop this proof of concept more by adding complex interactions. With this first iteration completed, I will have a better idea of the feasibility.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in some code, you can take a look <a href="https://github.com/karreiro/blocks-performance-test/blob/master/index.js#L132-L150">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it ;-)</p>
