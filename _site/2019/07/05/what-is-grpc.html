      <p>Micro-services architecture changed the way the industry thinks about scalability, deployment, and programming models. That’s a fact. We’re a step ahead now, thinking about tracing, resilience, elasticity, and high performance.</p>

<p>When we think about such kind of architecture, we imagine many nodes sending and receiving requests. <strong><em>Communication</em></strong> seems like the most valuable aspect.</p>

<p>Today most of the micro-services rely on REST APIs to handle communication. When people say REST, they are not just talking about the paradigm; actually, they suggest APIs that rely on JSON over HTTP/1.1. It’s a clear, simple, and human readable solution.</p>

<p>However, this conventional approach has some trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTTP/1.1 is a verbose protocol</li>
  <li>JSON is a verbose message format that requires a parser</li>
  <li>Consumers need to write their REST clients</li>
  <li>Interfaces are not type-safe</li>
  <li>Generally, it requires a documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>All problems above are not the end of the world, but if you want to avoid them, you might want to check <a href="https://grpc.io">gRPC</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gRPC is a modern open-source high-performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>gRPC relies on Protocol Buffers, or <em>protobufs</em>, for describing services, methods, and messages. See:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/karreiro/501add9efbe23da4c094359104724db0.js"></script>

<p>With the definition, a powerful compiler turns that into the code for a wide variety of programming languages, like Java, Ruby, Go, and JavaScript. Thus, consumers don’t need to write their clients. Instead, they can just import the generated code.</p>

<p>See how simple it’s to write a Java API server:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/karreiro/b83d859ce255637417ac05c55ce6901f.js"></script></p>

<p>And now, we can consume it into a Go client:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/karreiro/1005687597062549c1988a473e61d40f.js"></script></p>

<p>gRPC relies on HTTP/2 as its transport layer. So, it supports full-duplex streams, in other words, the client app can request data at the same time the server app sends response data.</p>

<p>Summarising all the advantages that gRPC brings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Protobufs binaries are faster than JSON</li>
  <li>HTTP/2 brings new features and is less verbose than HTTP/1.1</li>
  <li>Client libraries are generated for free</li>
  <li>Typed interfaces document all resources</li>
  <li>Lower response times</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are trade-offs in both approaches. gRPC has a learning curve and couples the app with the framework. But given the benefits, it’s clear why large organizations like Netflix, CoreOS, and Cisco adopted it.</p>
