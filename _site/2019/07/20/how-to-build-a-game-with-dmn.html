      <p>Some days ago, I showed a compelling use case of a DMN model as the brain of my financial bot. He still, eventually, gives me some advice to save money.</p>

<p>The gRPC framework is another interesting topic that we recently visited.</p>

<p>This week, we’re going to merge these two things into this old-school text-based game – the <strong>DMN Dungeon Demo</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to create a DMN model to describe the first room of our game. The challenge is: <em>Our hero woke up in a room completely locked. She can’t remember how she reached there, and she needs to get out.</em></p>

<p>The solution to this circumstance is: <em>After five turns, an enemy will appear with the key of the door in a necklace. The enemy has an HP of 10.
With a sword, each hit of the hero takes 5 HP points from the enemy, so the player can defeat the opponent before dying.
However, without a sword, each hit of the hero takes only 1 HP. In this case, the hero dies before the enemy.
With the enemy defeat, the hero can finally open the door with the key.</em></p>

<p>Here’s the DMN file that describes everything that happens in the room, including combat mechanisms, interactions with items, and the moment that enemies appear:
<img src="/assets/dmn-file-ddd.png" alt="DMN file that describes everything that happens" title="DMN file that describes everything that happens" /></p>

<p>The repository for the game is <a href="https://github.com/karreiro/ddd">here</a> (notice that each DMN file represent a room). Check a quick demo:
<a href="/assets/ddd-demo.gif"><img src="/assets/ddd-demo.gif" alt="Demo" title="Demo" /></a></p>

<p>This repository uses a naive implementation to recognize user commands. A future enhancement would involve natural language processing :-)</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed it!</p>
