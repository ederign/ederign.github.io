      <p>Today I’d like to share with you one of the many adventures that I had in my free time with weekend projects.</p>

<p>I’m not the most organized person with my financial life, however, I’m always trying to improve on that :-) I tried apps, lists, claiming for advice.. but nothing worked.</p>

<p>There are many aspects of your money you can control, and that’s awesome and super complex. But all aspects depend on one thing: you need to get rid of unnecessary expenses. You need to know how much you spent, and how much you can spend in the next few days.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that’s not easy. Every app that I tried is kind of bureaucratic, and I needed many steps and too much thinking to create a simple entry of a new expense. In the perfect world, I would have an assistant, and I could just say: - Jarvis, I spent 12 bucks with beer this evening, ok?
…and done, you know?</p>

<p>That’s what I did, look:
<a href="/assets/demo-bot.gif"><img src="/assets/demo-bot.gif" alt="Demo" title="Demo" /></a></p>

<p>This is a super simple bot, and you could try to make your own, I guarantee that you’ll have some hours of fun improving the behavior of it.</p>

<p>You just need to use two APIs: I) the one you will receive messages from Telegram, and II) the one that will send messages to telegram.</p>

<p>In my case, I’m using google spreadsheets as my database, because I found it easy to control. But you can use whatever you want to persist and process your entries.</p>

<p>Sometimes I get bored and I really would like to program something fun to improve my life, but I’m out of ideas. I had a very good time implementing this small project and I hope you have too. This is something really useful, easy to begin, and can be as complex as you want.</p>

<p>Check a draft <a href="https://github.com/karreiro/financial-bot">https://github.com/karreiro/financial-bot</a> and see how simple the bot can be.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this, and remember…</p>

<p>Have fun :-)</p>
