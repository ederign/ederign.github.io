      <p>The canvas is the most fascinating and powerful window on modern browsers. Whenever I see something intriguing that goes beyond what I visually would expect, I realize it’s a canvas trick.</p>

<p>However, breaking paradigms brings new challenges like accessibility, maintainability, and performance. Such flexibility comes with assuming trade-offs and the cost of re-implementing features that browsers deliver for free when we’re using standard HTML elements like input elements, text area elements, etc.</p>

<p>That’s why it’s essential to deeply understand how canvas works and if your use case really requires it.</p>

<p>Last week I faced this interesting article: <a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/05/28/drawing-2d-charts-with-webgl.html">https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/05/28/drawing-2d-charts-with-webgl.html</a>. I highly recommend the reading if you plan to build a canvas-based component, even if it’s not a chart.</p>

<p>In the end, it shows <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/DevAndyLee/raw/a901617de28912b1e3cbdc6e86d7ac26/">this excellent comparison</a>. So, even when you decided that you need to build a component based on canvas to solve your problem, you also need to take care of the approach you use to paint it. Otherwise, you might get poor performance.</p>

<p>As a general rule, you can assume WebGL is faster, more verbose, and do not handle texts very well. In comparison, the 2D context is a bit slower but easier to maintain and handle fonts fine. Of course, these are just some details. I believe the most valuable metric to track is the frames-per-second. If you can keep your component responsive and running 60fps, you super-OK from the performance perspective (you can check that using Google Chrome developer tools).</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that canvas components are an exciting choice, but they always bring a cost. So, it’s essential to be diligent, choose carefully, and consider all constraints :-)</p>
