I'm the Architect of Business Automation([Drools/jBPM/Kogito](http://kie.org/)) tooling teams.

Currently, I'm driving the execution of the [Multiplying Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvz0bGa9oh8&t=579s&ab_channel=KIE), a set of patterns, techniques, and libraries that, using micro frontends and some innovative Java and Go backend services, allow the reuse of the Developer Tooling components in different distribution mediums (Web, VS Code Extension, Standalone JS Library, Desktop, and GitHub).

 Such an architecture enables the Business Automation product line to offer the best native experience of GUI components (Editors and Views) on VS Code ([BPMN](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-extension-bpmn-editor) and [DMN](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-extension-dmn-editor)), Web ([dmn.new](https://dmn.new) and [bpmn.new](https://bpmn.new)), Desktop, and directly integrated them on GitHub([Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bpmn-dmn-test-scenario-ed/mgkfehibfkdpjkfjbikpchpcfimepckf)).

I'm fortunate to be a Java Champion and speaker in large conferences worldwide, including multiple QCons, Java One, Oracle Code One, Red Hat Summit and Forum, The Developers Conference, and numerous other community events.

I've also been  part of the [QCon Sao Paulo](https://qconsp.com/) program committee since 2014 and QCon SP conference chair in 2018 and 2019 editions. In 2021, I became part of Program Committee of [QCon Plus](https://plus.qconferences.com/).
